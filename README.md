# Vashantor: A Large-scale Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Automated Translation of Bangla Regional Dialects to Bangla Language

## Overview
Briefly describe your research project and its main goals.

## Abstract
The Bangla linguistic variety is a fascinating mix of regional dialects that adds to the culturaldiversity of the Bangla-speaking community. Despite extensive study into translating Banglato English, English to Bangla, and Banglish to Bangla in the past, there has been a noticeablegap in translating Bangla regional dialects into standard Bangla. In this study, we set out tofill this gap by creating a collection of 32,500 sentences, encompassing Bangla, Banglish,and English, representing five regional Bangla dialects. Our aim is to translate these regionaldialects into standard Bangla and detect regions accurately. To achieve this, we proposedmodels known as mT5 and BanglaT5 for translating regional dialects into standard Bangla.Additionally, we employed mBERT and Bangla-bert-base to determine the specific regionsfrom where these dialects originated. Our experimental results showed the highest BLEUscore of 69.06 for Mymensingh regional dialects and the lowest BLEU score of 36.75 forChittagong regional dialects. We also observed the lowest average word error rate of 0.1548for Mymensingh regional dialects and the highest of 0.3385 for Chittagong regional dialects.For region detection, we achieved an accuracy of 85.86% for Bangla-bert-base and 84.36%for mBERT. This is the first large-scale investigation of Bangla regional dialects to Banglamachine translation. We believe our findings will not only pave the way for future work onBangla regional dialects to Bangla machine translation, but will also be useful in solvingsimilar language-related challenges in low-resource language conditions.
